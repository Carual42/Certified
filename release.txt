Releases and Trademarks

Photographers who upload their photos to Unsplash grant users a free copyright license to their photos. A copyright license doesnâ€™t mean that photo can be used for every kind of use, and further approvals may be required. Just like any other photo sharing or stock photography site, other legal rights should be considered related to how the photo will be used. 

For people, places, and things, there are rights of privacy and publicity, access rights, trademarks, and copyright for whatâ€™s depicted within the photo.
 â€¯ 
Commercial use considerations: 
- Recognizable people, including celebrities, have the right to profit from 
commercial use of their name, image and likeness as well as the right to 
object to their name, image or likeness being used without approval.  
- Private property, restricted access areas, and ticketed entry 
locations often have photo shoot policies and specific release 
requirements for commercial uses.
- Objects that appear in the photo may have copyright or trademark 
protection that prohibit use of the photo without permission (for example,
a person wearing a t-shirt with a brand logo on it).
 
While photographers agree that photos uploaded to Unsplash have model 
releases, there is no reasonable way for us to monitor all photos that get uploaded 
to Unsplash. We cannot make any guarantees about the scope of permitted uses. 

We recommend reaching out to the photographer to clarify whether they have a 
model or property release. You can do this directly via the â€˜messageâ€™ button on the 
photographerâ€™s profile.
